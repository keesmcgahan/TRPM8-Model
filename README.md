# TRPM8-Model
A mathematical model for running simulations of a cold sensitive neuron

The .m Code is meant to be run in MATLAB. Currently is set to run a fixed temeprature simulation experiment. To change temperature for fixed temperature simulations, change T and TCK both inside and outside the function accordingly. To change to temeprature ramp simulation comment out appropriate sections as labeled in the code.

The .ode file is used in the interactive XPPAUT software. This file will allow for the creation of 1 and 2 parameter bifurcation plots.
